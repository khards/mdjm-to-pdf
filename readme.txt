MDJM to PDF compliments the MDJM Event Management for WordPress plugin by enabling exports of Event documentation to PDF

== Description ==

MDJM to PDF compliments the MDJM Event Management for WordPress plugin enabling you and your clients to convert Contracts and Quotes to PDF format for printing, saving or emailing.

Simple shortcodes enable you to easily add links to your client facing pages allowing them to print or download the relevant document.

* [mdjm-pdf-print text="Print"]
* [mdjm-pdf-download text="Download"]

Shortcodes can be used within Contract and Online Quote pages.

Additionally, you can override the default MDJM Event Management template settings so rather than sending a text based fully customised email, if you prefer you can configure MDJM to PDF 
to email a simple text based message and attach a selected template as a PDF file.

All attachments sent via email within the MDJM Event Management plugin with the MDJM to PDF plugin installed, are saved to your webserver. With email tracking enabled, you can view these emails, including their attachments, and even see if your client has opened it
